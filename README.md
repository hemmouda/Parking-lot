# Parking lot ![DEVELOPMENT STATUS: archive](https://badgen.net/badge/DEVELOPMENT%20STATUS/archive/orange)

A small Java GUI app that simulates a parking lot management system. I made it 
for a school _project_ back in 2021. I only found the compiled code, so I decompiled it.

I added a maven file to make it easily to build:

```bash
mvn clean compile exec:java
```
